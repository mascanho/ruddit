**Ruddit** is a command-line (CLI) application for interacting with Reddit, built with Rust.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Reddit API Interaction**: Connects to the Reddit API to fetch and interact with data.
- **Command-Line Interface**: All operations are performed through a comprehensive set of commands.
- **Database Storage**: Uses a local SQLite database to store data.
- **Data Export**: Export data to CSV and Excel formats.
- **Secure API Key Management**: Securely stores and manages your Reddit API keys.

## üöÄ Installation

To install Ruddit, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed. If you don't, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is set up, clone the repository and install the application:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd ruddit
cargo install --path .
```

This will install the `ruddit` executable in your Cargo bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`), making it available from anywhere in your terminal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using Ruddit, you need to configure your Reddit API keys.

1. **Create a Reddit App**: Go to your [Reddit apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) page and create a new "script" app.
2. **Set API Keys**: Use the following command to set your API keys:

   ```bash
   ruddit --api-key <your_client_id> --api-secret <your_client_secret>
   ```

## üíª Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be added here as the application develops.
